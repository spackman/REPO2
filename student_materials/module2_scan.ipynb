    "## Module 2: Coordinate Scans  \n",
    "---  \n",
    "By now, you should have seen that the CH3 radical and the CF3 radical do not have the same symmetry. To explore this further, you will perform a relaxed coordinate scan along the X-C-X bond angle.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Coordinate Scans - The Basics  \n",
    "Scanning bond lengths, bond angles or dihedrals is a common technique used in computational chemistry. This technique is often used to identify transition states or barriers to rotation, and some form of automated coordinate scan is implemented in most quantum mechanics modeling softwares. Scans can be performed as a **relaxed** coordinate scan, or a **rigid** coordinate scan. **Rigid** coordinate scans iteratively change only the bond length, angle or dihedral requested and maintain all other dimensions fixed during the course of the scan. In contrast, **relaxed** coordinate scans iteratively update the scanning dimension while allowing all other dimensions to 'relax\" to the lowest energy structure under the given constraint. We will use relaxed scans to allow the C-X bond length to change to minimize the energy of the resulting structures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For your system, you will be using an angle constraint to force the X-C-X bond angle to your set input. Rather than using ORCA's built-in coordinate scanning tool, we will generate a separate input file for each angle in the sweep. This will force you to flex your matrix algebra and python skills, and eliminate the need for a new output file parsing function (ORCA coordinate scan output files are a different format). For most normal uses, ORCA's built-in coordinate scan works just fine, and it will result in faster computations because it will autiomatically use guess parameters fromt eh previous step's wavefunction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To add a geometric constraint to your input file, you will need to modify your input file by adding the following code:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "%geom Constraints  \n",
    "    { A * 0 * C }   \n",
    "end  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This constraint sets the angle (A) between atom 0 (this should be your carbon atom) and all other atoms to be constant (C). Running an **opt freq** calculation with this constraint will allow the C-X bond lengths to change to minimize the energy of the system, but will not allow the X-C-X bond angle to change. This means that the bond angle of the starting geometry will be the bond angle of the optimized geometry.  \n",
    "To perform a bond angle scan, you will need to write a python code that can generate starting geometries with any bond angle you select.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating starting geometries  \n",
    "You will write a python function that takes an input X-C-X bond angle and write the coordinates for each atom.  \n",
    "You know:  \n",
    "* Your system contains 4 atoms  \n",
    "* You know the equilibrium bond lengths  \n",
    "* C-X bond will be 120 degrees apart when projected onto the plane formed by the three X atoms, regardless of the X-C-X bond angle  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Similar to the last unit, you will need to complete the missing custom functions `calculate_z_displacement()` and `scale_bond_lengths()` in the following code:  \n",
    "\\*note the helper function `check_bond_angles()` has been written for you\n",
