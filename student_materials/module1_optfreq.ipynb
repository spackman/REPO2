    "### What are PFAS?  \n",
    "PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a broad class of pollutants that are exceptionally difficult to break down in the environment. The general structure of a PFAS molecule is a carbon backbone with a per or polyfluorinated chain (i.e. H atoms are replaced by F in a typical hydrocarbon). It is this F substitution that makes PFAS so useful- the C-F bond is very strong, and these compounds are incredibly resistant to heat, abrasion and chemical attack. Common examples of PFAS are found in the teflon-coated stir bars used in chemistry labs, or in fire-fighting foams, industrial lubricants, waterproof clothing and even some fishing lines!  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Most methods currently being studied to degrade PFAS molecules into less harmful byproducts proceed through some form of radical intermediate. In this exercise, you will use the quantum mechanics modeling software ORCA to simulate the simplest hydrocarbon radical (CH3) and compare it to the simplest fluorocarbon radical (CF3). Choosing simple systems will make the analysis easier and ensure that the quantum calculations don't take too long.    \n",
    "  \n",
    "### What is ORCA?  \n",
    "ORCA is a quantum mechanical modeling software developed by Frank Neese's group at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. The program is free to use at academic institutions and can be installed on your own machine by making an account at [this site](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal). ORCA documentation is located [here](https://sites.google.com/site/orcainputlibrary/home) and some handy tutorials can be found [here](https://www.orcasoftware.de/tutorials_orca/#). ORCA is particularly well-known for their implementation of density-functional methods and ability to simulate spectroscopy, in addition to good perfromance with open shell (radical) systems.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### How does ORCA work?  \n",
    "Similar to may other quantum mechanics simulation software, ORCA uses a special kind of input file to specify the calculation parameters. The input files contain information that determines the level of theory (basis set and functional), the type of calculation (geometry optimizations, IR frequency simulations, other spectroscopy), and the starting locations for all of the atoms in the molecule you want to simulate. There are many other options that may be set, including options to specify solvents, temperatures and pressures, but we will focus primarily on the setting mentioned above.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Once you have written an input file, you will submit the file to the program to be processed. Some instituitons may already have ORCA installed on an HPC system for you to use, or you may run ORCA locally on your own machine.  \n",
    "ORCA will read the input file and perform the calculations requested, returning a log file describing the calculations made by the program and their results. This log file contains the data you will use to compare the CH3 radical to the CF3 radical.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### How do I write an input file?  \n",
    "As mentioned previously, input files contain all the information ORCA needs to know what kind of calculation to perform, and the system on which to perform the calculations.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Here is an example input file similar to the ones you will create:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "# pentafluoroethyl radical\n",
    "  \n",
    "! UKS TightSCF wB97x-D3 def2-TZVPD xyzfile opt freq  \n",
    "  \n",

    "C   0.609732   0.000059  -0.020541  \n",
    "*   \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "ORCA is fairly forgiving in how the input file is formatted.   \n",
    "* Any lines starting with `#` will be interpreted as comments, and you may write any information you need to help identify the job or describe the parameters\n",
    "    * In this example, the full name of the molecule is given in the comments  \n",
    "* Lines starting with `!` will be interpreted as commands\n",
    "    * In this example, the **Unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS)** modifier is applied to the **wB97x-D3** functional using the **def2-TZVPD** basis set. The options **TightSCF** sets the convergence criteria and **xyzfile** requests that the final geometry is written to a \\*.xyz file. Finally, the **opt freq** requests that ORCA first optimizes the geometry of the molecule and then perfroms and IR frequency calculation.  \n",
    "* The lines between `*` symbols define the starting geometry, charge and multiplicity of the system\n",
    "    * In this example, **xyz** specifies the format of the starting geometry, and **0 1*** specifies first the charge of the system (neutral) followed by the multiplicity (singlet/radical). For non-radical systems, the multiplicity is typically 1. The next lines contain the atom name followed by the starting coordinates in x,y and z (units are angstrom).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Module 1: Getting Started  \n",
    "---\n",
    "In this first exercise, you will:  \n",
    "1. Write input files to calculate the equilibrium geometry and IR frequencies for the CH3 and the CF3 radicals\n",
    "1. Read the output files generate by ORCA and locate useful information  \n",
    "1. Use python to write a function to extract interesting data from the output file  \n",
    "   >**IMPORTANT**: Look for `#### START YOUR CODE HERE ####` and `#### END YOUR CODE HERE ####` to indicate where you should edit code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Writing your input files  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In most computational projects, the first step is selecting an appropriate level of theory to use to model your system. This includes the choice of basis set, functional and other parameters, and is typically informed by literature review or benchmarking experiments. This step has been taken care of already. The **wB97x-D3** functional was selected because it performs well simulating IR frequencies, and the **def2-TZVPD** is a typical basis set for modeling PFAS molecules. **UKS** is used so that the program treats spin up and spin down electrons separately and is required for this open-shell calculation. **TightSCF** requests stricter convergence criteria in the self-consistent field iterative cycle than the default to ensure good results. Generating an xyzfile with the **xyzfile** command will be useful in later analysis.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "For the first calculations, you will simulate the equilibrium geometry and IR frequencies using the **opt freq** command. You may choose to draw your starting structure in a molecular editor such as Avogadro, or simply calculate the coordinates assuming a trigonal planar geometry using known C-H or C-F bond lengths. The second approach is recommended as you will need to interact with the bond lengths and angles in a matrix form in later steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">**IMPORTANT** Ensure that your input coordinates are structured so that the carbon atom is first, followed by the hydrogen atoms or the fluroine atoms. This will make analysis easier later on.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "When you have finished writing your input files, submit them to ORCA on your local machine or on your institution's HPC distribution. If you encounter difficulties, refer to the properly formatted input files located in the companion files.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Reading the output files  \n",
    "When the calculations are complete, open the output files (these typically have the extension \\*.out) to review the results. Spend a few minutes reading through the calculation results and answer the following questions:  \n",
    "1. How long did the job take to run?\n",
    "1. How many iterations did it take for the energy to converge? \n",
    "  \n",
    "For the activities to come, you will need to be able to locate the following information:  \n",
    "1. SCF energy  \n",
    "1. IR frequencies  \n",
    "1. Partial charges  \n",
    "1. Orbital energies  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Parsing data from the output files  \n",
    "Now that you have located the data you will need, you will write a python function to read your output file and parse the data. While it is possible to look through files manually and copy/paste data, using a python program to extract the data you need ensures that results are reproducible. This means that the code behaves consistently, and cannot accidentally copy results from the wrong section of the output file to your analysis files. If the wrong data is propogated, it will be recorded in the code in a way that is repeatable so that it can be easily addressed. In addition, writing a function to parse data from an output file will allow you to extract data much more efficiently than manually reading the files. This will become important in later activities when we need to process multiple files at once.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "There are many python packages written to parse output files for quantum chemical calculation, including [**iodata**](https://iodata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [**cclib**](https://cclib.github.io/index.html). We will use a combination of **cclib** and home-built functions to extract the data we need.  \n",

    "  \n",
    "The final parsing function we will use is shown below. Most of the **cclib** functions are already implemented, however, there are a couple of custom functions you will need to write.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's walk through this function:  \n",
    "* The `parse_outfile()` function will first read the file you input using the `cc.ccread()` method. This creates a python object that we can query.  \n",
    "* Next, we determine which heteroatom was used in the outfile by accessing the **cclib** attribute `atomnos`. We retrieve the second atom number (recall that python is zero-indexed) as a string, and use the heteroatoms dictionary to convert the atomic number to the element symbol.  \n",
    "* We then retrieve the final energy of the system by accessing the last element (-1) in the `scfenergies` array and use the built-in converter to convert from eV to hartrees.  \n",
    "* Similarly, we retrieve the final coordinates using the -1 index on the `atomcoords` array. Using the coordinates of the optimized geometry, we calculate the average bond lengths and angles.  \n",
    "*This is a custom function you will write.*  \n",
    "* The second to last IR frequency in the `vibfreqs` array corresponds to the C-X bond stretch. When we later scan the bond angle, this may not always be true.  \n",
    "* After the C-X bond frequency is retrieved, we calculate the force constant using the custom function `calculate_force_constant()`.  \n",
    "*This is a custom function you will write.*  \n",
    "* The last two steps require the custom functions `get_partial_charges()` and `get_frontier_orbital_energies()`.  \n",
    "*You will write the function to retrieve the partial charges. The function to retrieve the frontier orbital energies has been written for you.*  \n",
